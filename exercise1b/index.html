                <p>             for the     pasta:</p>
                        <p>                         1/3 cup     olive oil</p>
                        <p>                         6     garlic cloves,     peeled and thinly sliced</p>
                        <p>                         1 medium     green serrano chile,     stemmed and halved lengthwise</p>
                        <p>                         1 tablespoon     fresh thyme leaves,     chopped</p>
                        <p>                         2 15.5-oz cans     cannellini beans,     drained and rinsed</p>
                        <p>                         3 cups short, twirled     pasta,     preferably gemelli or trofie pasta</p>
                        <p>                         3 cups     vegetable stock</p>
                        <p>                         kosher salt     and     black pepper</p>
                        <p>                         1/4 cup     lemon juice     (from 2 lemons)</p>
                        <p>                         1 block     halloumi,     very finely grated</p>
                <p>             for the     arugula (rocket) pesto:</p>
                        <p>                         heaping 1/3 cup     pine nuts,     well toasted</p>
                        <p>                         2 small     garlic cloves,     roughly chopped</p>
                        <p>                         3 lightly packed cups     arugula (rocket),     roughly chopped</p>
                        <p>                         1/2 cup roughly chopped     parsley     (leaves and tender stems only)</p>
                        <p>                         1/3 cup     olive oil,     plus more as needed</p>
                        <p>                         kosher salt     and     black pepper</p>
                <p>  steps</p>
                        <p>                         prepare the     pasta:     add the     oil     to a large, lidded saut√© pan, and then place it over medium-high heat. 
                         once hot, add the     garlic     and     chile,     and cook for 2 minutes, stirring often, until the     garlic    
                         is nicely golden. stir in the     thyme,     beans,     pasta,     stock,     2 teaspoons     salt     and plenty of
                              pepper,     and bring to a simmer. turn the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 12 minutes. remove from the heat
                         and let sit, with the lid off, for about 5 to 10 minutes. this will help it absorb more of the liquid.</p>
                        <p>                         as the     pasta     cooks, make the     pesto:     to a food processor, add the     nuts,     garlic,
                              arugula (rocket),     parsley,     half the     oil,     1/2 teaspoon     salt     and a good grind of     pepper.     
                         pulse a few times, scraping down the sides and pulsing again until you have a coarse paste. transfer to a small bowl
                         and stir in the remaining     olive oil,     adding a touch extra if needed to loosen the     pesto.</p>
                       <p>                         when ready to serve, stir the     lemon juice     and half the     pesto     into the     pasta     (discard the
                              chile,     if you wish) and transfer to a large serving bowl or platter with a lip. sprinkle over about half the
                              halloumi,     and serve with the extra     halloumi     and     pesto     to eat alongside.</p>
                        <p>                         bask in the deliciousness.</p>
