            <h2>STEPS</h2><span id="steps">
            <ol>
                <li>PREPARE THE PASTA: ADD THE OIL TO A LARGE, LIDDED SAUTÃ© PAN, AND THEN PLACE IT OVER MEDIUM-HIGH HEAT. ONCE HOT, ADD THE GARLIC AND CHILE, AND COOK FOR 2 MINUTES, STIRRING OFTEN, UNTIL THE GARLIC IS NICELY GOLDEN. STIR IN THYME, BEANS, PASTA, STOCK, 2 TEASPOONS SALT AND PLENTY OF PEPPER, AND BRING TO A SIMMER. TURN THE HEAT TO MEDIUM, COVER, AND COOK FOR 12 MINUTES. REMOVE FROM THE HEAT AND LET SIT, WITH THE LID OFF, FOR ABOUT 5 TO 10 MINUTES. THIS WILL HELP IT ABSORB MORE OF THE LIQUID.</li>
                <li>AS THE PASTA COOKS, MAKE THE PESTO: TO A FOOD PROCESSOR, ADD THE NUTS, GARLIC, ARUGULA (ROCKET), PARSLEY, HALF THE OIL, 1/2 TEASPOON SALT AND A GOOD GRIND OF PEPPER. PULSE A FEW TIMES, SCRAPING DOWN THE SIDES AND PULSING AGAIN UNTIL YOU HAVE A COARSE PASTE. TRANSFER TO A SMALL BOWL AND STIR IN THE REMAINING OIL, ADDING A TOUCH EXTRA IF NEEDED TO LOOSEN THE PESTO.</li>
                <li>WHEN READY TO SERVE, STIR THE LEMON JUICE AND HALF THE PESTO INTO THE PASTA (DISCARD THE CHILE, IF YOU WISH) AND TRANSFER TO A LARGE SERVING BOWL OR PLATTER WITH A LIP. SPRINKLE OVER ABOUT HALF THE HALLOUMI, AND SERVE WITH THE EXTRA HALLOUMI AND PESTO TO EAT ALONGSIDE.</li>
                <li>BASK IN THE DELICIOUSNESS.</li>
