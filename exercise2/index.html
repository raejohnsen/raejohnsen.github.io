            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <span id="pasta"><h3>For the pasta:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>6 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 medium green serrano chile, stemmed and halved lengthwise</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped</li>
                <li>2 15.5-oz cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
                <li>3 cups short, twirled pasta, preferably gemelli or trofie pasta</li>
                <li>3 cups vegetable stock</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 cup lemon juice (from 2 lemons)</li>
                <li>1 block halloumi, very finely grated</li>
            </ul></span>
            <span id="rocket"><h3>For the arugula (rocket) pesto:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Heaping 1/3 cup pine nuts, well toasted</li>
                <li>2 small garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
                <li>3 lightly packed cups arugula (rocket), roughly chopped</li>
                <li>1/2 cup roughly chopped parsley (leaves and tender stems only)</li>
                <li>1/3 cup olive oil, plus more as needed</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
            </ul></span>
            <span id="steps"><h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the pasta: add the oil to a large, lidded sauté pan, and then place it over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the garlic and chile, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring often, until the garlic is nicely golden. stir in the thyme, beans, pasta, stock, 2 teaspoons salt and plenty of pepper, and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, with the lid off, for about 5 to 10 minutes. This will help it absorb more of the liquid.</li>
                <li>As the pasta cooks, make the pesto: To a food processor, add the nuts, garlic, arugula (rocket), parsley, half the oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper. Pulse a few times, scraping down the sides and pulsing again until you have a coarse paste. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the remaining olive oil, adding a touch extra if needed to loosen the pesto.</li>
                <li>When ready to serve, stir the lemon juice and half the pesto into the pasta (discard the chile, if you wish) and transfer to a large serving bowl or platter with a lip. Sprinkle over about half the halloumi, and serve with the extra halloumi and pesto to eat alongside.</li>
                <li>Bask in the deliciousness.</li>
