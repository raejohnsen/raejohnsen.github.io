<!-- https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022548-pesto-pasta-with-white-beans-and-halloumi -->
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <h3>for the pasta:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium green serrano chile, stemmed and halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>2 15.5-oz cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>3 cups short, twirled pasta, preferably gemelli or trofie pasta</li>
        <li>3 cups vegetable stock</li>
        <li>kosher salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice (from 2 lemons)</li>
        <li>1 block halloumi, very finely grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>for the arugula (rocket) pesto:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>heaping 1/3 cup pine nuts, well toasted</li>
        <li>2 small garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>3 lightly packed cups arugula (rocket), roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup roughly chopped parsley (leaves and tender stems only)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup olive oil, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>kosher salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>prepare the pasta: add the oil to a large, lidded saut√© pan, and then place it over medium-high heat. once hot, add the garlic and chile, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring often, until the garlic is nicely golden. stir in the thyme, beans, pasta, stock, 2 teaspoons salt and plenty of pepper, and bring to a simmer. turn the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 12 minutes. remove from the heat and let sit, with the lid off, for about 5 to 10 minutes. this will help it absorb more of the liquid.</li>
        <li>as the pasta cooks, make the pesto: To a food processor, add the nuts, garlic, arugula (rocket), parsley, half the oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper. pulse a few times, scraping down the sides and pulsing again until you have a coarse paste. transfer to a small bowl and stir in the remaining olive oil, adding a touch extra if needed to loosen the pesto.</li>
        <li>when ready to serve, stir the lemon juice and half the pesto into the pasta (discard the chile, if you wish) and transfer to a large serving bowl or platter with a lip. sprinkle over about half the halloumi, and serve with the extra halloumi and pesto to eat alongside.</li>
        <li>bask in the deliciousness.</li>
    </ol>
