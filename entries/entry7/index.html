                    <div class="text">The film uses religious imagery, particularly Christian iconography, throughout. The visuals of Powell's tattooed knuckles with the words "Love" and "Hate" symbolize his twisted interpretation of religion and his dual nature. This imagery underscores the theme of the corrupting influence of false faith and the misuse of religious authority.</div>

                <div class="overlay">
                    <div class="text">One of the most prominent visual elements in the film is the use of light and shadow. The stark contrast between light and darkness is used to represent the struggle between good and evil, a central theme of the movie. </div>

                <div class="overlay">
                    <div class="text">The visuals often focus on the children, John and Pearl, who are pursued by Powell. Their vulnerability is emphasized through cinematography and imagery. Their small, innocent figures contrast with the looming, threatening presence of Powell. These visuals serve to highlight the film's theme of the innocence of children in the face of evil.</div>

                <div class="overlay">
                    <div class="text">Water is a recurring visual motif in the film. It is used to create a dreamlike quality, but it also symbolizes the river as a place of refuge and salvation for the children. The underwater shots of Willa's body and the children's boat journey contribute to the film's ethereal and sometimes nightmarish atmosphere.</div>

                <div class="overlay">
                    <div class="text">The film's rural, Southern Gothic setting is brought to life through visuals. The idyllic countryside landscapes create a stark contrast with the horrors that lurk beneath the surface. This contrast reflects the theme of hidden evil and the idea that darkness can exist even in the most seemingly serene places.</div>

                    <div class="text">"The Night of the Hunter" often uses dreamlike, almost surreal sequences that are visually captivating and eerie. These sequences serve to reinforce the idea that the film operates on a symbolic level, reflecting the children's journey as a kind of fairy tale or allegory.</div>
