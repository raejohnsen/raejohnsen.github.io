The film's visuals are so vibrant, it's like someone spiked my eyeballs with a rainbow cocktail at a haunted disco.

If you ever wondered what it would be like if a prog-rock band got possessed by a demonic conductor, wonder no more!

Who knew that witchcraft came with a side of haute couture?

Just be prepared to question your life choices if you ever decide to enroll in a dance academy in the Swiss Alps.

                        Dakota Johnson stars as Susie Bannion, who decides to join a dance academy in Berlin. Little does she know, it's not your typical dance academy where they teach you pliés and pirouettes; it's more like a crash course in witchcraft 101. Johnson's performance is as enigmatic as the plot itself, leaving you wondering whether she's here to dance or perform an exorcism.

                        Tilda Swinton, on the other hand, is absolutely in her element, playing not one but multiple roles, because why not? One minute she's Madame Blanc, the intimidating artistic director, and the next she's Dr. Klemperer, the elderly psychotherapist who seems to have stumbled into the weirdest workplace ever. It's like watching an actor's version of "Freaky Friday" without the swapping bodies part.

It's almost as if Guadagnino had a checklist of how many gruesome deaths he could fit into one film.

It's not your typical horror film; it's more like a descent into madness set against the backdrop of a dance academy that could use some serious renovations. So, put on your dancing shoes and get ready to waltz into a world where witches and ballet go hand in hand – or should I say, foot in spell?
