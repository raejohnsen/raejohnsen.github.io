        <div class="words">END CREDITS<br><br>LetterboxdGPT as an experiment has neither succeeded nor failed, since the goal of the project was simply to discover what one example of artificial intelligence is capable of generating on the subject of film. Though I had inklings that the reviews I received would not be as nuanced or clever as human-generated ones found on Letterboxd (or anywhere else), it was not my goal to prove that artificial intelligence is useless or unreliable in this context. For the most part, it is accurate. I can only recall two instances in which ChatGPT got its facts mixed up, which both occurred in the entry for <span class="italic">The French Dispatch</span>, a relatively niche and recent film. The accuracy with which it commented on the themes and motifs of older movies like <span class="italic">The Night of the Hunter</span> was shocking to me. I gave up my attempts to generate witty responses after a few weeks since ChatGPT’s idea of “humor” was growing redundant, and a little bit painful. At this point, the AI-generated responses became less the centerpiece of each entry and more a jumping-off point for its design. No longer seeking a specific result from ChatGPT was freeing in the sense that I could focus more on applying new coding techniques to produce a result that I loved. It’s been so fun and rewarding to work with films that I enjoy and try to emulate, or at least compliment them in some way.<br><br>Thank you for exploring LetterboxdGPT!<br><br>-Rae
