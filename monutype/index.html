    <h2>Peter Cooper &<br>Sarah Bedell Cooper</h2>
    <img src="https://images.findagrave.com/photos/2021/47/108495358_7393ec75-0e60-4227-b770-73c09c7cf595.png" style="width:100%" />
    <p>
      Peter Cooper (February 12, 1791 – April 4, 1883) was an American industrialist, inventor, philanthropist, and politician. 
      He designed and built the first American steam locomotive, the Tom Thumb, founded the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, 
      served as its first president, and stood for election as the Greenback Party's candidate in the 1876 presidential election.
      <br><br>
      Cooper began tinkering at a young age while working in various positions in New York City. He purchased a glue factory in 1821 and used that 
      factory's profits to found the Canton Iron Works, where he earned even larger profits by assembling the Tom Thumb. 
      Cooper's success as a businessman and inventor continued over the ensuing decades, and he became the first mill operator to successfully use 
      anthracite coal to puddle iron. He also developed numerous patents for products such as gelatin and participated in the laying of the first 
      transatlantic telegraph cable.
      <br><br>
      During the Gilded Age, Cooper became an ardent critic of the gold standard and the debt-based monetary system of bank currency, advocating instead 
      for government-issued banknotes. Cooper was nominated for president at the 1876 Greenback National Convention, and the Greenback ticket of Cooper 
      and Samuel Fenton Cary won just under one percent of the popular vote. His son Edward and his son-in-law Abram Hewitt both served as Mayor of New York City.<br><br>
      In 1813, Cooper married Sarah Bedell (1793–1869). Of their six children, only two survived past the age of four years: a son, Edward and a daughter, Sarah Amelia. Edward served as Mayor of New York City, as would the husband of Sarah Amelia, Abram S. Hewitt, a man also heavily involved in inventions and industrialization.<br><br>
      Peter Cooper's granddaughters, Sarah Cooper Hewitt, Eleanor Garnier Hewitt and Amy Hewitt Green founded the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, then named the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, in 1895. It was originally part of The Cooper Union, but since 1967 has been a unit of the Smithsonian Institution.

    <h2>Maria Heuys<br>(Boerum)</h2>
    <img src="Heuys.jpg" style="width:100%" />
    <p>Maria Heuys is the wife of Simon Boerum. Simon Boerum (February 29, 1724 – July 11, 1775) was a farmer, miller, and political leader from Brooklyn, New York. He represented New York in the Continental Congress in 1774 and 1775. He signed the Continental Association.<br><br>
Boerum's family settled on Long Island when it was a part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland. His parents farmed in the town of New Lots, in Kings County, New York, which is now part of Brooklyn. Simon was born there on February 29, 1724, and was baptized in the Dutch Reformed Church on March 8. He attended and graduated from the Dutch school in Flatbush. Boerum farmed and operated a mill in Flatbush. In 1748, he bought a home and garden at what is today the southwest corner of Fulton and Hoyt streets in downtown Brooklyn. On April 30, 1748, he married Maria Schenck (1726–1771), and the house became their home for the rest of their lives.<br><br>
In 1750, Governor George Clinton appointed Boerum as county clerk for Kings County. He would hold that office for the rest of his life, as well as a seat in the Province of New York Assembly after 1761. In 1774, the Assembly could not reach agreement about the Continental Congress. Kings County selected him to represent them, and on October 1, 1774, the Congress added him to the New York delegation. In the Congress, he supported the non-importation agreement and the more radical members in general. He helped to defeat the Galloway Plan for union and reconciliation with England.<br><br>
Early in 1775, the Colony's Assembly rejected the work of the first Congress and was hurriedly adjourned to prevent further measures from consideration. In April, Boerum was elected to the revolutionary New York Provincial Congress. That body in turn named him once again to the Continental Congress, but illness soon forced his return from Philadelphia. Simon died at home on July 11, 1775, and was originally buried in the Dutch Burying Ground in New Lots. Brooklyn's Boerum Hill neighborhood (where his home was located) is named after him.<br><br>
      In 1849, an ordinance was passed which banned burials within Brooklyn's city limits. Maria Heuys' (and her husband, Simon Boerum's) grave is one of many relocated from the First Dutch Church, Dutch Reformed Church, and St. Ann's Church into Green-Wood Cemetery in the following years.<br><br>There is little available record of Maria's life apart from her husband. Her grave reads, in Dutch, "Here lies the body of Maria Heuys, wife of Simon Boerum, born on the 10th day of January Anno Domini 1726, and died on the 31st day of March Anno Domini 1771, being aged 45 years, 2 months, and 21 days."</p>

    <h2>George<br>Washington Whistler</h2>
    <img src="https://d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/w1200h1200/collection/GLA/HAG/GLA_HAG_54134-001.jpg" style="width:100%" />
    <p>
      George Washington Whistler (May 19, 1800 – April 7, 1849) was an American civil engineer best known for building steam locomotives and railroads. 
      He is credited with introducing the steam whistle to American locomotives.
      <br><br>
      In 1842, Tsar Nicholas I hired him to build the Saint Petersburg–Moscow Railway, Russia's first large-scale railroad. One of Whistler's important 
      influences was the introduction of the Howe truss for the Russian railroad's bridges. This inspired the renowned Russian engineer Dmitrii Ivanovich 
      Zhuravskii to perform studies and develop structural analysis techniques for Howe truss bridges.
      <br><br>
      He was the father of American artist James McNeill Whistler, whose painting "Whistler's Mother" (of his second wife Anna Whistler) is among the 
      most famous paintings in American art.
